\par{Atomic Rydberg Units(aru) form a set of units that are covenient to use in atomic and molecular physics. They are determined by the choice of values for the following physical qunatities: electron mass ($m_e$), electron charge ($e$), Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom $a_0$, the ground state energy of the free hydrogen atom $E_h$, reduced Planck's constant $\hbar$ and electric constant $\epsilon_0$. Fixing any four of them will fix automatically the other two.}
\par{We choose $\hbar=2m_e=\frac{e^2}{2}=a_0=1$}
\par{To determine the electric constant or electric permittivity of vacuum we start from the definition of the Bohr Radius}
\be
a_0=\frac{\hbar^24\pi\varepsilon_0}{m_ee^2} = 5.291772080\times 10^{-11}\;\metre
\ee
\par{and replacing the known values we get}
\be
\varepsilon_0=\frac{1}{4\pi}
\ee
\par{The Rydberg energy becomes}
\begin{equation}
E_h=\frac{m_ee^4}{2\hbar^2(4\pi\varepsilon_0)^2} = 1 = 2.17987197\times10^{-18}\;\joule = 13.6056919\;\eV
\end{equation}
\par{up to this point we established the values for the six physical quantities. We need to establish the units for time. We know that the time is the ration between an angular momentum and energy, so}
\be
t_0=\frac{\hbar}{E_h} = \frac{2\hbar^3(4\pi\varepsilon_0)^2}{m_ee^4} = 1 = 4.83776864\times10^{-17}\;\second
\ee
\par{Now in principle we have the units to compute all other units. As an example we compute the speed $v$. The speed is the ratio between space and time, so}
\be
v=\frac{a_0}{t_0}=\frac{e^2}{8\hbar\pi\varepsilon_0}=1=1.09384562\times10^{6}\;\metre/\second
\ee
