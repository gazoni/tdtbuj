abstract     = {There is a continuing growth of interest in the computer simulation of materials at the atomic scale, using a variety of academic and commercial computer programs. In all such programs there is some physical model of the inter-atomic forces, which may be based on something as simple as a pair interaction, such as the Lennard-Jones model, or as complex as a self-consistent, all-electron solution of the quantum mechanical problem. For a student or researcher, the basis of such models is often shrouded in mystery, It is usually unclear how well founded they are, since it is hard to find a discussion of the physical assumptions that have been made in their construction. The lack of clear understanding of the scope and limitations of a model may lead to its innocent misuse, resulting either in unfair criticism of the model or in dissemination of nonsensical results. In the present book, models of the inter-atomic forces are derived from a common physical basis, namely the density functional theory. The interested reader will be able to follow the detailed derivation of pairwise potentials in simple metals, tight-binding models from the simplest to the most sophisticated (self-consistent) kind and various ionic models. The book is self-contained required no more background than provided by an undergraduate quantum mechanics course. It aims to furnish the reader with a critical appreciation of the broad range of models in current use, and to provide the tools for understanding other variants that are described in the literature. Some of the material is new, and some pointers are given to possible future avenues of model development.},

abstract     = {The tight-binding method of modelling materials lies between the very accurate, very expensive, ab initio methods and the fast but limited empirical methods. When compared with ab initio methods, tight-binding is typically two to three orders of magnitude faster, but suffers from a reduction in transferability due to the approximations made; when compared with empirical methods, tight-binding is two to three orders of magnitude slower, but the quantum mechanical nature of bonding is retained, ensuring that the angular nature of bonding is correctly described far from equilibrium structures. Tight-binding is therefore useful for the large number of situations in which quantum mechanical effects are signiﬁcant, but the system size makes ab initio calculations impractical. In this paper we review the theoretical basis of the tight-binding method, and the range of approaches used to exactly or approximately solve the tight-binding equations. We then consider a representative selection of the huge number of systems which have been studied using tight-binding, identifying the physical characteristics that favour a particular tightbinding method, with examples drawn from metallic, semiconducting and ionic systems. Looking beyond standard tight-binding methods we then review the work which has been done to improve the accuracy and transferability of tight-binding, and moving in the opposite direction we consider the relationship between tight-binding and empirical models.},

abstract     = {. We present a tight-binding modelofcohesion andinteratomicforceswhich exploits the variational principle of density functional theory. The binding energy of a solid is expressed as a sum of four terms, each of which has a clear physical meaning. The first two terms are the covalent bond and promotion energies, which are found by solving the electronic Hamiltonian to obtain the density matrix. The remaining two terms describe changes in the total electrostatic and exchange-correlation energies on forming the solid from isolated atoms. The variational principle allows these two terms to be expressed as functionals of a superposition of frozen atomic charge densities. We show that they may then be approximated by a sum of pair potentials. The importance of self-consistency in tight-binding models is discussed with particular attention to the evaluation of the bulk modulus and certain interatomic force constants by frozen-phonon calculations. It is shown that serious errors may arise in non-self-consistent models due to the violation of charge conservation and the neglect of variations in the potential caused by charge flow. We advocate local charge neutrality as the simplest approximation to self-consistency which overcomes these problems. This assumption leads to a remarkably simple expression for the force on an atom due to its neighbours, which is both physically transparent and computationally efficient. These concepts are illustrated for three-dimensional solids by calculations of covalent bond energies in BCC, FCC and HCP transition metals using a canonical d-band model. Model one-dimensional calculations are also presented which illustrate the computation of covalent bond energies and interatomic forces at surfaces and interfaces, and the importance of local charge neutrality in the model.},

Following Harris, Foulkes and Haydock, the methods are based on an expansion of the Kohn-Sham total energy in density-functional theory (DFT) with respect to charge density fluctuations at a given reference density. While the zeroth order approach is equivalent to a common standard non-self-consistent tight-binding (TB) scheme, at second order by variationally treating the approximate Kohn-Sham energy a transparent, parameter-free, and readily calculable expression for generalized Hamiltonian matrix elements may be derived. These matrix elements are modified by a Self-Consistent redistribution of Mulliken Charges (SCC). Besides the usual ``band-structure and short-range repulsive terms the final approximate Kohn-Sham energy explicitly includes Coulomb interaction between charge fluctuations. The new SCC-scheme is shown to successfully apply to problems, where defficiencies within the non-SCC standard TB-approach become obvious. These cover defect calculations and surface studies in polar semiconductors (see M. Haugk et al. of this special issue), spectroscopic studies of organic light-emitting thin films, briefly outlined in the present article, and atomistic investigations of biomolecules (see M.

This scheme provides a direct bridge between the electronic level modeling and the atomistic modeling, where the electronic degrees of freedom have been coarse grained into many-body interatomic potentials. In this paper we construct BOP in which both the attractive and the repulsive contributions to the binding energy are environmentally dependent due to both the nonorthogonality of the orbitals and the breathing of the screening charges. The construction of the BOP is described and tested in detail. First, the energies of alternative crystal structures A15, fcc, hcp, simple cubic are calculated and compared with those evaluated ab initio. The transferability of the BOP to atomic conﬁgurations that deviate signiﬁcantly from the bcc lattice is studied by computing the energies along tetragonal, trigonal, and hexagonal transformation paths. Next, the phonon spectra are evaluated for several symmetrical crystallographic directions and compared with available experiments. All these calculations highlight the importance of directional bonding and the investigation of phonons demonstrates that the environmental dependence of the bond integrals is crucial for the phonons of the N branch not to be unphysically soft. Finally, the constructed BOP was applied in the modeling of the core structure and glide of the 1/2 111 screw dislocation. The calculated structure of the core agrees excellently with that found in the recent ab initio calculations and the observed glide behavior not only agrees with available ab initio data but is in agreement with many experimental observations and explains the primary reason for the breakdown of the Schmid law in bcc metals.},

Applications are given to the results of Fletcher and Wohlfarth on Ni, and Howarth on Cu, as illustrations of the fcc case. In discussing the bcc case, the splitting of the energy bands in chromium by an antiferromagnetic alternating potential is worked out, as well as a distribution of energy states for the case of no antiferromagnetism. For diamond, comparisons are made with the calculations of Herman, using the orthogonalized plane-wave method. The case of such crystals as InSb is discussed, and it is shown that their properties fit in with the energy band picture.},

abstract     = {This paper contains a derivation of general expressions for reducing Slater-Koster integrals Eij(l,m,n) to the two-center approximation for orbitals i (and j) having arbitrary angular momentum quantum numbers; l,m,n describe the location of one center relative to the other. This has allowed the author to check the entries in Table I of the Slater-Koster paper and provides a means for extending these entries to include states of higher angular momenta. The derived general expressions are especially useful for machine calculations when a large number of particular expressions are required to be evaluated. As a collateral result the missing factors in the energy matrix elements along the $\Delta$ line for the face-centered cubic structure given by Slater and Koster and reviewed by Reitz have been noted. see eratum Sharma80},

abstract     = {. This survey covers the state of the art of techniques for solving general purpose constrained global optimization problems and continuous constraint satisfaction problems, with emphasis on complete techniques that provably ﬁnd all solutions (if there are ﬁnitely many). The core of the material is presented in suﬃcient detail that the survey may serve as a text for teaching constrained global optimization. After motivation for and important examples of applications of global optimization, a precise problem deﬁnition is given, and a general form of the traditional ﬁrst order necessary conditions for a solution. Then more than a dozen software packages for complete global search are described. A quick review of incomplete methods for bound constrained problems and recipes for their use in the constrained case follows, an explicit example is discussed, introducing the main techniques used within branch and bound techniques. Sections on interval arithmetic, constrained propagation and local optimization are followed by a discussion of how to avoid the cluster problem. Then a discussion of important problem transformations follows, in particular of linear, convex, and semilinear (= mixed integer linear) relaxations that are important for handling larger problems. Next, reliability issues – centering around rounding error handling and testing methodology – are discussed, and the COCONUT framework for the integration of the diﬀerent techniques is introduced. A list of challenges facing the ﬁeld in the near future concludes the survey.},

Despite its widespread use, essentially no theoretical results have been proved explicitly for the Nelder–Mead algorithm. This paper presents convergence properties of the Nelder–Mead algorithm applied to strictly convex functions in dimensions 1 and 2. We prove convergence to a minimizer for dimension 1, and various limited convergence results for dimension 2. A counterexample of McKinnon gives a family of strictly convex functions in two dimensions and a set of initial conditions for which the Nelder–Mead algorithm converges to a nonminimizer. It is not yet known whether the Nelder–Mead method can be proved to converge to a minimizer for a more specialized class of convex functions in two dimensions.},

It permits uphill moves under the control of a probabilistic criterion, thus tending to avoid the first local minima encountered. The algorithm has been tested against the Nelder and Mead simplex method and against a version of Adaptive Random Search. The test functions were Rosenbrock valleys and multiminima functions in 2,4, and 10 dimensions. The new method proved to be more reliable than the others, being always able to find the optimum, or at least a point very close to it. It is quite costly in term of function evaluations, but its cost can be predicted in advance, depending only slightly on the starting point.},
