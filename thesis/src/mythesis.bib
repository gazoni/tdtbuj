abstract     = {A simple but novel method is described to prove the addition theorems for solid harmonics. This method gives new insight into the richness of the contents of the expansions of plane waves and the Coulomb potential between two point particles in terms of complete set of spherical harmonics. As a concrete application of the addition theorem for the regular solid harmonic, an integral containing the spherical harmonic Yml which frequently occurs in the second Born term is evaluated in a compact form.},

abstract     = {This is the most complete handbook on the quantum theory of angular momentum. Containing basic definitions and theorems as well as relations, tables of formula and numerical tables which are essential for applications to many physical problems, the book is useful for specialists in nuclear and particle physics, atomic and molecular spectroscopy, plasma physics, collision and reaction theory, quantum chemistry, etc. The authors take pains to write many formulae in different coordinate systems thus providing users with added ease in consulting this book. Each chapter opens with a comprehensive list of its contents to ease the search for any information needed later. New results relating to different aspects of the angular momentum thoery are also included. Containing close to 500 pages this book also gathers together many useful formulae besides those related to angular momentum. The book also compares different notations used by previous authors.},

abstract     = {We have presented a method for the evaluation of the Coulomb-Born matrix element between arbitrary initial and final Slater orbitals. Since for the two- or more-electron ionic target the wave functions may be constructed by the combination of the Slater orbitals of various angular momenta, one can easily apply this method to calculate the cross sections for the electron-impact excitation of a complex ion from an arbitrary initial state to an arbitrary final state. As an example we have calculated the excitation cross sections of the He+ ion from the ground state to the 4f state at several energies.},
